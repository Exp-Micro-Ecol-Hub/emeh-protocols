Guidelines for contributing
===========================

We invite you to assist us improve, update, and add to these protocols.

The protocols are maintained on github (and only recreated here on readthedocs). To contribute, go to the [github repository](https://github.com/opetchey/emeh-protocols), and contribute by one of these methods:

1. Create an Issue (the simpler option). For this you need to have a github account and to follow the [guidelines about creating issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
2. Use a pull request (the more involved option). See here for more information on [using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Both are described here: [Contributing to a Project](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing)

Revisions suggested by either of these methods will be reviewed by Owen Petchey and or Florian Altermatt, or a delegate of them, potentially discussed, and then either accepted or not. If not accepted, the suggestion and discussion will remain present on this website (as an Issue).

Any questions? Email Owen Petchey.
