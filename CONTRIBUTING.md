We invite you to assist us improve, update, and add to the protocols in this repository.

There are two ways to do this:

1. Create an Issue (the simpler option). For this you need to have a github account and to follow the [guidelines about creating issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
2. Use a pull request (the more involved option). See here for more information on [using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Both are described here: [Contributing to a Project](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing)
