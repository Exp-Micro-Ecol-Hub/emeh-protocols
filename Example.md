Protocol for counting protists via dissecting microscope
========================================================

This is a temporary draft/example protocol that will be replaced once the associated paper is accepted for publication.

Material / equipment / space
----------------------------
* Dissecting microscope with dark field illumination.
* PPM media for dilution (the diluent), in a jar (must not contain any protists).
* At least three times as many 5cm diameter plastic petri dishes as microcosms to count, in a plastic tub or box.
* Some paper towels.
* A clicker counter.
* A plastic tub to put used petri dishes in.
* Container for disposing of pipette tips or Pasteur pipettes.
* About 1m of bench space.
* Tissue for clean microscope optics.
* Datasheet for recording information.
* Pen for writing on datasheet.
Either
*200ul pipette & 1 1000ul pipette, with sterile tips for the 200ul/1000ul.
*Balance accurate to 0.01g, sterile Pasteur pipettes, teats.

Method 1 – using a Gilson pipette
1. Enter onto the datasheet that you are using this method. Do not switch between methods.
2. Ensure that microcosms are out of the experimental environment for as short a time as possible.
3. Get a plastic petri dish ready to receive a sample.
4. Loosen the lid of the microcosm, so it can be removed with one hand.
5. Get a pipette with sterile tip ready in one hand.
6. Swirl the microcosm to well mix the contents.
7. Remove lid with one hand (do not put down the lid) withdraw a sample with the pipette that you have in your other hand, replace the lid. The volume of this sample is Volume.1 on the datasheet.
8. Put the lid back onto the microcosm, and move the microcosms to a safe place. We are finished with it, and don’t want to risk knocking it over, or putting something back into it.
9. Distribute the sample in small drops onto the clean petri dish.
10. Look at the drops under the dissecting microscope. Adjust illumination and magnification as required. If the drops contain few enough individuals, count now using a clicker counter to make a running total across all the drops. (You need record only the total number of individuals in all drops, not the number in each drop.)
11. If the drops contain too many individuals to count, you need to dilute. Use the 1000ul pipette to put a suitable amount of diluent into the petri dish (the volume of diluent is Volume.2 on the datasheet), and mix well with the sample, by squirting in and out of the pipette. Now do steps 6 (possible parts of), 7, 8 on this diluted liquid, putting the sample of the diluted media onto a new petri dish. The volume in step 6 is now Volume.3 on the datasheet.
12. Make sure on the datasheet you have written: number of individuals counted (in column Count), the volumes of liquid sampled, and the time (in column Time). If there was no dilution, enter dashes in columns Volume.2 and Volume.3 (do not leave these blank).
13. Put used petri dishes into the plastic tub for this.


Method 2 – using a balance
--------------------------
1. Enter onto the datasheet that you are using this method. Do not switch between methods.
2. Ensure that microcosms are out of the experimental environment for as short a time as possible.
3. Get a plastic petri dish ready to receive a sample: put it onto the balance, tare the balance, put the dish back on the desk.
4. Loosen the lid of the microcosm, so it can be removed with one hand.
5. Get a sterile Pasteur pipette ready in one hand.
6. Swirl the microcosm to well mix the contents.
7. Remove lid with one hand (do not put down the lid) withdraw a sample with the pipette that you have in your other hand, replace the lid.
8. Put the lid back onto the microcosm, and move the microcosms to a safe place. We are finished with it, and don’t want to risk knocking it over, or putting something back into it.
9. Distribute the sample in small drops onto a clean petri dish.
10. Place the dish on the balance and record the weight in the Volume.1 column.
11. Look at the drops under the dissecting microscope. Adjust illumination and magnification as required. If the drops contain few enough individuals, count now using a clicker counter to make a running total across all the drops. (You need record only the total number of individuals in all drops, not the number in each drop.)
12. If the drops contain too many individuals to count, you need to dilute. Use the 1000ul pipette to put a suitable amount of diluent into the petri dish (the volume of diluent is Volume.2 on the datasheet). Put the dish onto the balance again, and record the new weight in column Volume.2 of the datasheet.
13. Get a  fresh plastic petri dish ready to receive a sample of the diluted sample: put it onto the balance, tare the balance, put the dish back on the desk.
14. Mix the diluent well with the sample, by squirting in and out of the pipette. Now do steps 7 (possible parts of), 8, 9, 10 on this diluted liquid, except the volume in step 9 is now Volume.3 on the datasheet.
15. Make sure on the datasheet you have written: number of individuals counted (in column Count), the volumes of liquid sampled, and the time (in column Time). If there was no dilution, enter dashes in columns Volume.2 and Volume.3 (do not leave these blank).
16. Put used petri dishes into the plastic tub for this.

Clean up
--------
1. Wash the plastic petri dishes, wiping the surface with a sponge, and giving them a quick rinse, then stacking them to dry.
2. Wipe down surfaces.
3. Tidy workspace so that others could use it.
4. Clean scope optics as required (using appropriate methods).
5. Ensure adequate supplies are available for next sampling event.

Tips and tricks
---------------
* How long should this take? You will be quite slow at first, but will speed up a lot. For a monoculture, this process should take a couple of minutes for one microcosm. Clean up could take about 15 minutes.
* What volume to sample? Often removing 0.5ml is a good option. However, when population sizes are low, this may result in high sampling error (e.g., zero counts when individuals are present). When population sizes are high, considerable diluent will be required (a couple of mls). With experience, you will be able to adjust the volume sampled, and the volume of diluent, to get good counts.
* What is a good count? We’d like to get a least ten individuals minimum across the whole sample, and not more than about 15 per drop maximum. We control the maximum by dilution. We can’t always have so much control over the minimum, since this is in large part determined by the population density in the microcosm.
* What if we need to have accurate counts of rare species? We then have to sample a larger volume. We could withdraw 5ml, place it into a sterile petri dish, count individuals in it, and put it back into the media. If we’re happy with replacing with 5ml of fresh media at each sample, we don’t have to worry about sterility here.
* What if my communities contain multiple species? Use the same method, but be ready to count some species in the undiluted sample, and others in the diluted sample. Two different dilutions may be required. It may even be useful to couple sampling of small volumes for abundant species, with larger volumes for rare species. All this adds lots of time to the processes. Sampling a community with 10 or more species can take over 15 minutes.
* What about counting algae? Separate protocol on its way.
* What about the automatic counting by analysis of videos? Separate protocol on its way. 
* You may find it useful to remove samples from multiple microcosms in the room with the incubator, and then count these wherever. This avoids lots of going back and forth, or removing multiple microcosms from incubators for prolonged periods.
