# Welcome to Experimental Microbial Ecology Protocols

A repository of protocols associated with Experimental Microbial Ecology (see here [www.emeh.info](http://www.emeh.info) for a description of what this is).

See associated paper [title and link to be added when manuscript is accepted for publication].

Only one example protocol is present until an associated manuscript is accepted for publication (though all are in the appendix of the submitted manuscript).

Please see [here](contributing.md) for how to contribute to this repository.
