**1.4 Apparatus**

**Introduction**

A laboratory equipped with general microbiological apparatus is required for protist microcosm experiments (Fig. S1). Furthermore, general laboratory glassware is needed. Protists cultures can be maintained and handled with general laboratory equipment. Importantly, all equipment used must be inert with respect to chemical leaking into the medium (e.g., using silicon tubes or glass jars). Jars and pipettes used must be rinsed with deionized water before autoclaving/use, to get rid of detergents. For experiments, glass jars or polystyrol-multiwell plates have been proven successful. Care needs to be taken when vessels are self-made, as for example silicone glue used to seal containers mostly contains antifouling chemicals that leak into the medium and kill protists (even from silicone glue recommended for aquaria use).

**Materials**

***Equipment***

For general lab-procedures, the following equipment is needed:

-   Labcoat.

-   Disposable gloves.

-   Labelling tape and water proof pens.

-   Autoclave bags (to autoclave/dispose biohazard waste).

-   80% denaturated alcohol (to clean surfaces).

-   2% bleach (to dispose cultures).

For the general procedures involving medium preparation, experimental set-up, and analyses of basic protist microcosm experiments, the following equipment is needed:

-   Microbalances (precision 0.1 mg).

-   Autoclave (Fig. S2).

-   Incubators (temperature range 5 to 40 °C, light controlled) (Fig. S3) or temperature controlled walk-in chamber (Fig. S4)

-   pH meter.

-   Stereomicroscopes with zoom and dark field illumination (i.e., dissection microscope, Fig. S5).

-   Sterile bench.

For the handling and culturing of protists in microcosms, the following equipment is needed:

-   200 mL glass jars (e.g., Erlenmeyer jars) to grow protist cultures.

-   2 L autoclavable containers to prepare the medium.

-   Measuring glass beakers.

-   Micropipettes (1–10 µL, 10–100 µL, 100–1000 µL, 1–5 mL).

-   Petridishes (Polystyrol).

-   Small vials to take subcultures (e.g., scintillation vials, 10 or 50 mL PP tubes).

Fig. S3. Example of an incubator with individual protist microcosms (showing the experiment by Mächler & Altermatt 2012). The incubator is temperature-controlled (20 °C) and has constant fluorescent lighting. The position of the replicates of each treatment is randomized across the incubator to avoid biases due to position in the incubator. Photo by Elvira Mächler.

Note: for working on the microscopes, blinds of the windows would be lowered to avoid reflections and uncontrolled illumination. Next to the microscopes, a calendar is given to reserve slots for individual work-projects. Photo by Florian Altermatt.
