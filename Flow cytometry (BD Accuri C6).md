# Protocol for measuring bacterial abundances using the BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer

## Introduction

The system is the flow cytometer, the plate sampler, and the computer.

Have one person responsible for tasks such as calibration / validation.

## Materials

### Equipment

- BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer, with Sampler and computer.
- 24 well plates.
- 96 well plates.
- Racks, eppendorf tubes.
- Various pipetters.
- Personal protection equipment.

### Reagents

- Decontamination fluid
- Cleaning fluid
- Filtered water
- 70% ethanol
- sybr green (this is stored in the freezer in brown eppendorfs at 100x, so dilute to 10x by mixing 500 ul iwth 4500 ul filtered water).



## Procedure

### Preparation the machine
1. Ensure that the machine has been calibrated / validate successfully within the last few weeks. Check this with the person responsible.
2. Each day put the machine through a wash (see below).
2. Switch on the FC and computer. FC startup can take about 10 minutes.
3. Ensure adequate liquid levels in the four attached bottles. Full bottles (except for waste) are sufficient for about 8 96 well plates (about two days).
4. Open the "BD CSampler Software" using the shortcut on the desktop. Do not open the BD Accuri C6 Software, as this cannot drive the Plate Sampler.

### Washing the machine
1. In the software, open a template: "File", in the "washes" folder, "_shutdown wash".
2. Place in a 24 well plate at least 1ml of:
  1. Position A1, decontamination liquid (yellow bottle).
  2. A2: Cleaning fluid (green bottle).
  3. A3: Filtered water.
  4. A4: 70% ethanol
  5. Same as A3.
3. If required, press Eject plate.
4. Place the 24 well plate with cleaning liquid in the Sampler (ensure A1 is in the A1 position).
5. Click on Agitate to agitate the plate.
6. Switch to Autocollect tab, press Open Run display, press Autorun, name the file as wash_dd_mm_yy_number.
7. Press save and start the run.
8. Watch the number of events per ul during A3 and A5, it should decrease to less than 10 (approx.).

### Preparing a 96 well plate

*Caution: sybr green is nasty stuff, so wear gloves, labcoat, eye-protection.*

1. Take samples from microcosms.
2. The following is for a 1:10 dilution of the sampled media.
3. Add 160 ul filtered water to each well in the 96 well plate.
4. Put 20 ul of sample into each well (vortex sample and mix with pipetter in the well).
5. Add 20 ul sybr green (10x) per well, using the multipipetter plus.
6. Agitate the plate, carefully by hand, or using the Sampler.
7. Incubate at 37C for 15min in dark.

### Starting a 96 plate run


## Timing
1. Startup - 20 mins.
2. 96 well plate preparation - 45 mins (including 15 min incubation).
3. Starting sampling - 5 mins.
4. Sampling x mins.
5. Clean up - 10 mins.
